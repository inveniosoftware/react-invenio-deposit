/**
 * The current version of Formik does not allow to pass a context/arg to the submit action.
 * The assumption is that there must be only one Submit button in a form.
 * As a workaround, each submit button (Save, Publish, etc...) will:
 * 1. call `setSubmitContext` with the action name as first param (mandatory) and any extra context, if needed.
 * 2. call `formik.handleSubmit` to trigger the action.
 *
 * This might be fixed in future versions of Formik. See:
 * - https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues/214
 * - https://github.com/jaredpalmer/formik/issues/1792
